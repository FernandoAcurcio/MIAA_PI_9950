    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficient scheduling of classes in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is crucial for ensuring optimal resource utilization and a seamless learning experience. However, manual scheduling processes are prone to errors and often fail to account for complex interdependencies between factors such as teacher availability, classroom capacities, and course requirements. To address these challenges, this project focuses on developing an automated scheduling system using advanced computational tools. By leveraging optimization techniques and prescriptive analysis, the system aims to generate conflict-free schedules that meet all established criteria, fostering a harmonized educational environment and enhancing the overall efficiency of HEI operations."

    "3. It should aim to avoid conflicts and unwanted overlaps in schedules.<br>\n",
